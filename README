Work in progress service that uses the Boston MBTA data to make intelligent routing choices.  Currently this is in a very early state with work focusing on importing and cleansing the raw and live datasets as well as getting the routing algorithm to a decent state.

To run you'll need to mbta data set from the mbta website, the following files are needed and should be placed in data\mbta

agency.txt
calendar.txt
calendar_dates.txt
feed_info.txt
frequencies.txt
routes.txt
shapes.txt
stop_times.txt
stops.txt
transfers.txt
trips.txt

Currently on application load these files will be parsed and a property graph built using Tinkerpop's Blueprints library backed by neo4j.

An early A-star implementation exists but a final heuristic has not been built.

There is also a feed parser for the MBTA live data implemented and triggered with a Quartz job.

The service is accessed via JSON over HTTP.
